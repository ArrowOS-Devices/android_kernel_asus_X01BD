SkyWalker 4.4.x Kernel Source
====================================

Getting Started
---------------
You can use this source if u Want , 
There is has 2 Variant , HMP and EAS .

Just Copy, Paste, Then Execute the command :)

Make sure `androidboot.version` has defined on Boot Cmdline with
ur Android Version due of this commit: 
```bash
https://github.com/RyuujiX/android_kernel_asus_sdm660/commit/b6f50a7917e4336495f6b2642064f90d9babed7d
```

OverClocked Kernel
------------------
This Kernel is Overclocked. If u want go Back to Stock Freq, Do this:

On Branch r6/hmp & r6/eas:
```bash
   git revert 542000eb0f463ae4995c144991964456e4aa0c10 -n && \
   git commit -m "Use Back Stock Freq"
```

About NLV & LV
--------------
It was LV by default and Enabled only for A11+. If u want to disable it,
Define "0" at `led.vibration` on boot cmdline.

For Android 10 and 9 will set `led.vibration` to "0" / NLV as default

Using Pie / CAF 7.2 WiFi Drivers
--------------------------------
This Kernel is using R / CAF 9.2 WiFi drivers , So if u want to use
Pie WiFi Driver , do this :

On Branch r6/hmp and r6/eas:
```bash
   rm -rf drivers/staging/qcacld-3.0 drivers/staging/fw-api drivers/staging/qca-wifi-host-cmn && \
   git add . && \
   git commit -m "Remove R WLAN DRIVERS" && \
   git revert 1d6e1bb682f0f280a758eba771890f926492296f -n && \
   git commit -m "Use Back Pie CAF 7.2 WiFi Drivers" 
```

I Recommend to use Pie WiFi Drivers coz it's more optimal :)

Compile for Android Pie
-----------------------

For X00TD, Just Use Pie WiFi Driver.

For X01BD, do this also after Using Pie WiFi Driver:

On Branch r6/hmp and r6/eas:
```bash
   git revert be578e2def2d7a67d6643335d016008f7bee8da8 -n && \
   git revert 5c27bb6d8547112a8b815742c5dbcaae520b4497 -n && \
   git commit -m "Fix WiFi for Android 9"
```

EAS Perf HAL
------------
Usually, X00TD and X01BD Device Trees is using HMP Perf HAL as default.

So, if u want to build ROM with Prebuilt EAS Kernel, Pick this EAS Perf HAL:

Spectrum Support
----------------
Pick Spectrum Script from Here: https://github.com/RyuujiX/spectrum , then rename it to init.spectrum.rc

HMP : ryuu

EAS : eas

Or , make it by ur self .
